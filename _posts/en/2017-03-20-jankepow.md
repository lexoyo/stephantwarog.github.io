After years without coding, I met the guys of Silex Labs association, during a short workshop about Javascript and game development. I was motivated to go and refresh my skills about JS, as i coded before in Action Script (flash ah aaaah !). The project Jankenpow is an idea which sleeps in my mind for years, as i remind the good old times when i used to play alex kidd after school :) There was an epic moment as you must beat bosses with devilish Shifumi game (actually thats my souvenir as a kid, and im afraid this moment should be less heroic with a grownup look). Nowadays, I was interested by passing the good old Shifumi as a rogue adventure journey for solo player, and a multiplayer instant game for mobile.

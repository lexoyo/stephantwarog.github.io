Animation work for Loigny Museum in France. Rigging and animation based of illustrations with a really good rough style ! Important work of preparation and cleanup on backgrounds and existing art pieces, which are used in the movie. Some of this old paintings and prints have been rigged and animated too. This short movie recounts the hard life of french soldiers during the 1870-71 war against Germany, and the key events of the fierce battle of Loigny.

As i continue my journey as a coder, i decided to explore the Haxe language. It was a kind of natural way for Action Script former coders (?) The guys at Silex Labs were found of the game Hedge Wars, a free software inspired by the famous Team 17 hit, Worms. So we decided to make our own version of that game in Haxe, on order to fully experiment the language and some most used libraries (flixel, nape). As we wanted to adapt the game for a mobile use, we faced first real issues about the gameplay itself, mobile players can't wait for 2 minuts beetween each turn @@ We'd have to change some game principles in order to accelerate the turn and get more dynamism in the game. The projet stops after few weeks, as other prior pops, as ever. We found a cool name, and some interesting game pitch : cute demon blasting unicorns. With a bazooka.

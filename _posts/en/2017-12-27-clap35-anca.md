Illustration proposals for a comic strip project. ANCA chair (ANCA for Alimentation Nourriture Comportement Alimentaire - Food Nutrition Eating Behaviour). This is the story of a group of friends, who meet every year at the same date from 2020 to 2050. Every passing years, the eating behaviour changes, as changing the group of friends, and the society itself. The goal is to depict a forecast study about our future eating behaviours. The format is original as it fits for social networks, inspired by the summer comic project of Arte : "été".

At the start of january 2017, the Chapatiz Project was ceased to a new team. As the company failed to go through its hard times. That was hard moments, beetween trade court, administrative ambush and winter times. The company died, but the project will survive, as a new team is hot as hell to realize what we dreamed of ! So now, I did quit the project. I got back to my previous activity, 15 years ago, Freelancer in graphic design, well, well, well, so. What did i miss during this 15 years of Chapatiz ? What will be the next journey ? Who knows ?
